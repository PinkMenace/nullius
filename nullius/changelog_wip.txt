changelog in construction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 2.0.1
Date: 2025
  Changes:
    -Renamed a lot of recipe's internal names in order to merge them with their products in factoriopedia
  Comments:
    Here is the list of renames I was unsure of, in the end I did not do most of them, but I keep a record of the ideas: (also see the commented lines in clutterpedia.lua)
  -wastewater -> sand disposal (does it make sense to have one main recipe though ??
  -air -> nullius-air-filtration (have to rename the fixed recipe for air filters)
  -seawater -> salination (have to rename the fixed recipe for air filters)
  -sludge -> wastewater filtration/dust disolution
  -carbon dioxide -> oxygenated air separation ?/dust disolution sulfuric(that would changes the main_product of the original recipe)
  -hydrogen -> water electrolysis
  -oxygen -> oxygenated air separation/steam electrolysis
  -steam -> hydrogen combustion
  -calcium chloride solution -> calcium chloride 1
  -residual gas -> air separation 2
  -sulfur dioxide -> volcanic separation 1
  -boric acid -> volcanic separation 2
  -trace gas -> volcanic separation 3
  -sodium hydroxide -> brine electrolysis
  -sodium -> salt electrolysis 
  -chlorine -> hydrogen chloride electrolysis
  -helium -> trace separation

Version: 2.0.0
Date: 2025
  Features:
    - Updated to 2.0
    - Added landing pad: Now the results of rocket launches will be collected there
    - Re-introduced red and green wires so there is a seamless transition to 2.0
    - Added essential techs
    - Added command to flip all valves (i will remove it when i'm convinced it's not needed anymore)
    - Added display panels and selector combinator
    - Added setting to hide the voiding recipe icon from chimneys and outfalls
    - Added circuit connections to most buildings
    - Added settings to control the sound of wind turbines
  Changes:
    - Reworked the inserters: Removed filter inserters, now base inserters have filters except tier 1, their recipes have been adapted
    - Removed mirror buildings, use 2.0 flipping instead, removed chirality research
    - Added a trigger tech "Salvage lab wreckage"
    - Removed regular artillery shortcut and discharge defense shortcut
    - Changed required techs for most shortcuts
    - Now uses the Valve prototype for valves
    - Changed plumbing and pumping checkpoints to reflect lesser need for pumps in 2.0 fluid system
    - Made tanks rotatable/flippable
  Balancing:
    - Increased the pumping speeds of pumps (and max flow rate)
  Bugfixes:
    - 
  Graphics:
    - Added icons for drones ammo categories
    - Reworked voiding recipes icons to make them standout more in factoriopedia
    - Altered lime recipe icon so that it's distinguishable from the item in the signals gui
    - Altered recipe icons for: nuclear fuel cell recycling, hydrochloric acid, hydrogen chloride,seawater filtration, freshwater filtration for signal gui
  Info:
    - Added description to inserters 
    - Renamed the extension tech to inserter extension
    - Tweaked description texts of landing entities to make them less ambiguous
    - Removed mentions of the old pressure system
  Modding:
    - Removed the dependency on angels, now only depends on the graphics
    - Now supports elevated rails
    - Support for quick adjustable inserters
    - Made factorissimo's factory buildings stackable again so the nullius recipes can be made in an assembler
