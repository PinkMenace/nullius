TODO list:
add working_sounds to entities (i think)
Fix fluid boxes (volume and pipe connections)
Valves, pipes and tanks: fix mentions of pressure in locales
Rework the entity mirroring system
Rework the checkpoint system (maybe)
fix the others warnings in the log
landfill transitions things -> i have no clue how this thing works and if i even have to do anything
fix factoriopedia duplicate entities (maybe wait for kiwi's modding request to go through)
mods compatibility
do we remove the legacy items/recipes/buildings ?
why does grass drone take this long to spawn grass ?? -> it also takes very long on 1.1
decide what to do with angels stuff : depend only on the graphics ? then we'll have to recreate some of their entities and re implement some of angels functions
update changelog and info.json(min version of dependencies) before publishing
drones ammo category locale broken
coal spawn in rocks -> crystal rock with silica and alumina: okay it's from 1.1
there are other kinds of rocks: rock, sandstone rock, bauxite rock, ironstone rock -> spawns sandstone, bauxite, iron ore, regular stone, soda ash, calcite
mentions of petroleum in factoriopedia/what the extractor can mine
missing geothermal plant graphics
some of the mining drills that use the electric drill graphics have the vector_to_place_result set to the burner drill value so the little is not in front of the animation BUT this is how it is in nullius 1.1 so I didn't change it
