TODO list:
Rework sounds: remove vehicle impact sound, add impact-category instead (i think)
add working_sounds to entities (i think)
Fix fluid boxes (volume and pipe connections) pipes hold as much fluid as medium tank for instance
Fix valves
Rework the entity mirroring system
Rework the checkpoint system (maybe)
Update the recipe ingredients format
fix the others warnings in the log
landfill transitions things -> i have no clue how this thing works and if i even have to do anything
fix factoriopedia duplicate entities (maybe wait for kiwi's modding request to go through)
fix the localised names missing : logistics, fluid voiding and boxed recipes
mods compatibility
do we remove the legacy items/recipes/buildings ?
why does grass drone take this long to spawn grass ?? -> it also takes very long on 1.1
decide what to do with angels stuff : depend only on the graphics ? then we'll have to recreate some of their entities and re implement some of angels functions
fix or make better voiding icons for recipes (it's difficult to identify the recipes in factoriopedia (in the "used in" section))
selector-combinator and display panel not included in mod
update changelog and info.json(min version of dependencies) before publishing
