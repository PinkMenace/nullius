TODO list:
add working_sounds to entities (i think)
Fix fluid boxes (volume and pipe connections)
Valves, pipes and tanks: fix mentions of pressure in locales
Rework the checkpoint system (maybe)
fix the others warnings in the log
landfill variants are not the same as on 1.1
mods compatibility
fix factoriopedia duplicate entities (maybe wait for kiwi's modding request to go through)
do we remove the legacy items/recipes/buildings ? Probably not
why does grass drone take this long to spawn grass ?? -> it also takes very long on 1.1
update changelog and info.json(min version of dependencies) before publishing
geothermal plant can mine petroleum in nullius 1.1 is it a bug ?
some of the mining drills that use the electric drill graphics have the vector_to_place_result set to the burner drill value so the little is not in front of the animation BUT this is how it is in nullius 1.1 so I didn't change it
airfilter graphics are not symmetric when rotating -> it causes the alt icon to be off center in certain orientations
alignment issue in multiplayer -> probably need a warning message when not every player has the setting enabled
hide the rest of military equipment and their related ammo categories that are unused (what to do if other mods reintroduces those ?)
new branch chirality_rework -> remove all the mirror buildings, use legacy system to introduce new symmetrical fluid boxes for entities like flotation cell (see the electromagnetic plant in SA that seems to have a weird symmetry)
crash report for turbine crash (seems to be caused by engine itself)
someone is missing the near inserters tech with bobinserters
someone is blocked from researching aesthetics-1 because of an invisible dependency
weird visualization for underground pipe pack
pumps slower than expected -> is it because of flow_scaling ?
