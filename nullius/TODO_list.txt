landfill variants are not the same as on 1.1
mods compatibility
drones ammo category locale broken
fix factoriopedia duplicate entities (maybe wait for kiwi's modding request to go through)
do we remove the legacy items/recipes/buildings ?

update changelog and info.json(min version of dependencies) before publishing
geothermal plant can mine petroleum in nullius 1.1 is it a bug ?
some of the mining drills that use the electric drill graphics have the vector_to_place_result set to the burner drill value so the little is not in front of the animation BUT this is how it is in nullius 1.1 so I didn't change it
